Archive of my solutions of the labs of the Digital Systems course at Eurecom.

You can check the [original readme](/original-readme.md) to have an overview of what the labs were.

My solutions to the labs are in the [vhdl](/vhdl) folder.

The [solutions](/solutions/vhdl) folder contains the solutions given by the teacher once the labs were finished.

Thank you, to Mr Pacalet (renaud.pacalet@telecom-paris.fr) for giving me the authorization to upload this repo publicly.
