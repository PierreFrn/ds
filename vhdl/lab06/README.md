# CODING CHALLENGE: counter (30 minutes)

Counters are a very common element in digital hardware.
We used counters already when designing [our timer](../lab03/).
This challenge consists in designing a counter with _force-to-zero_ and _increment_ control inputs.

## Specifications

The entity is named `counter` and its architecture is named `rtl`.
Generic parameters:

| Name       | Type                            | Description                                                         |
| :----      | :----                           | :----                                                               |
| `cmax`     | `natural`                       | maximum value of counter                                            |

Input-output ports:

| Name       | Type                            | Direction | Description                                                             |
| :----      | :----                           | :----     | :----                                                                   |
| `clk`      | `std_ulogic`                    | in        | master clock, the design is synchronized on the rising edge of `clk`    |
| `sresetn`  | `std_ulogic`                    | in        | **synchronous**, active **low** reset                                   |
| `cz`       | `std_ulogic`                    | in        | if asserted **high**, force counter to zero                             |
| `inc`      | `std_ulogic`                    | in        | if asserted **high**, increment counter                                 |
| `c`        | `natural range 0 to cmax`       | out       | current value of counter                                                |

* The design is synchronized on the rising edge of `clk`.
* `sresetn` is a **synchronous**, active **low** reset that forces the counter to 0.
* On rising edges of `clk`, `c` is:
   * forced to 0 if `cz` is high,
   * else incremented by one if it is strictly less than `cmax` and `inc` is high,
   * else unmodified.

The following waveform shows the behaviour of `counter` with `cmax = 5`.

## Schematic

As usual, before coding the VHDL model, draw a schematic of the digital hardware.

## VHDL coding

Edit the file named `counter.vhd`.
Code the `counter` entity and the `rtl` architecture.
Stick to your schematic, just translate it into VHDL.

## Validation

Validate your design using the provided simulation environment.

## Peer review

After the end of the challenge, compare your solution with your neighbours'.
