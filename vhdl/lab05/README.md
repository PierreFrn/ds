# CODING CHALLENGE: 3-stages re-synchronizer and edges detector (20 minutes)

This challenge consists in designing a 3-stages re-synchronizer and detector of edges of a `data_in` input signal that comes from a different clock domain.

## Specifications

The entity is named `edge` and its architecture is named `rtl`.
Input-output ports:

| Name       | Type                            | Direction | Description                                                                  |
| :----      | :----                           | :----     | :----                                                                        |
| `clk`      | `std_ulogic`                    | in        | master clock, the design is synchronized on the rising edge of `clk`         |
| `sresetn`  | `std_ulogic`                    | in        | **synchronous**, active **low** reset                                        |
| `data_in`  | `std_ulogic`                    | in        | data input signal                                                            |
| `re`       | `std_ulogic`                    | out       | asserted **high** during 1 `clk` period when `data_in` rising edge detected  |
| `fe`       | `std_ulogic`                    | out       | asserted **high** during 1 `clk` period when `data_in` falling edge detected |

* The design is synchronized on the rising edge of `clk`.
* There is a 3-bits [shift register](../lab02/) used to re-synchronize the `data_in` input signal.
* `sresetn` is the **synchronous**, active **low** reset of the shift register.
* The `re` output is asserted high during one `clk` period when a rising transition of `data_in` is detected.
* The `fe` output is asserted high during one `clk` period when a falling transition of `data_in` is detected.

Warning: `data_in` must be synchronized by at least two stages of the shift register before it can be used in the `clk` clock domain; do not use the output of the first stage of the shift register, it could enter any time in a metastable state.
The following waveform shows the expected behaviour of `edge`.
Carefully study the latency between the edges of `data_in` and the effects on `re` and `fe`.

## Schematic

As usual, before coding the VHDL model, draw a schematic of the digital hardware.

## VHDL coding

Edit the file named `edge.vhd`.
Code the `edge` entity and the `rtl` architecture.
Stick to your schematic, just translate it into VHDL.

## Validation

The provided simulation environment makes use of a random generation package (`rnd_pkg`) from a library named `common` that must be compiled first:

```bash
$ cd $sim
$ ghdl -a --std=08 --work=common $ds/vhdl/common/rnd_pkg.vhd
$ ghdl -a --std=08 $ds/vhdl/lab05/edge.vhd $ds/vhdl/lab05/edge_sim.vhd
$ ghdl -r --std=08 edge_sim --vcd=edge_sim.vcd
<and use GTKWave to open the VCD file edge_sim.vcd>
```

Or:

```bash
$ cd $sim
$ vcom -2008 +acc -work common $ds/vhdl/common/rnd_pkg.vhd
$ vcom -2008 +acc $ds/vhdl/lab05/edge.vhd $ds/vhdl/lab05/edge_sim.vhd
$ vsim -voptargs="+acc" edge_sim
```

Or:

```bash
$ cd $sim
$ xvhdl -2008 -work common $ds/vhdl/common/rnd_pkg.vhd
$ xvhdl -2008 $ds/vhdl/lab05/edge.vhd $ds/vhdl/lab05/edge_sim.vhd
$ xelab -debug all edge_sim
$ xsim -gui edge_sim
```

## Peer review
